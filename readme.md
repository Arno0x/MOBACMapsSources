Map sources for Mobile Atlas Creator (MOBAC)
============

[Mobile Atlas Creator](http://mobac.sourceforge.net/) (*formerly known as TrekBuddy Atlas Creator*) is an open source (GPL) program which creates offline atlases for GPS handhelds and cell phone applications like TrekBuddy, AndNav and other Android and WindowsCE based applications. For the full list of supported applications please see the features section. Additionally individual maps can be exported as one large PNG image with calibration MAP file for OziExplorer. As source for an offline atlas Mobile Atlas Creator can use a large number of different online maps such as OpenStreetMap and other online map providers.

These are my files for defining additionnal map sources. They are known to work with MOBAC v1.9.16 and MOBAC v2.0.0.

Installation of the map sources
--------------

Once Mobile Atlas Creator is installed on your system, you just need to drag these map source files into the `mapsources` directory within Mobile Atlas Creator installed directory.
